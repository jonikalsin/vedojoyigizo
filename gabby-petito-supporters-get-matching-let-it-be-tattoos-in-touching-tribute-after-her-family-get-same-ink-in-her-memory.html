Like hunting your asses down to teach you a lesson about respect.”</p><p>“Seriously stop,” wrote the commenter. “How do you think her mother & parents would feel, as THATS THEIR WAY OF BEING CONNECTED to her.”</p><p>The person said the effort was offensive.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s the last thing they have of her & you wanna go & ruin it by “adding yourself to their circle” ABSOLUTELY WRONG & DISRESPECTFUL!!”</p><p>A person who admitted getting the tattoo 10 years ago did so “because I was bullied really bad in school” and struggled with addiction.</p><p>The person didn’t agree with getting such a tattoo to pay respects to the late young woman.</p><p>“But I would never get “ let it be” in memory of gabby… unless I knew her personally,” the person confessed.</p><h2><strong>MISSING TO MURDERED</strong></h2><p>Gabby was last seen on August 24, 2021, checking out of a hotel with Brian in Salt Lake City, <a href=#>Utah</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When <a href=#>Gabby</a> was first reported missing, photos of her tattoos were being shared as a way to confirm her identity.</p><p>Since Gabby’s remains were found on September 19<strong> </strong>in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming her distinct tattoos were used to verify the body as Gabby’s.</p><h2>‘BELIEVE’</h2><p>The “believe” and “Let It Be” tattoos serve as a somber reminder of Gabby’s faith, and the firm belief her parents professed in the early days of the search, that <a href=#>their daughter would come home</a>.</p><p>The wave and flower tattoos signify Gabby’s appreciation of natural abundance.</p><p>Her love of nature was a central tenet of the young vlogger’s personality, and a pivotal force behind her <a href=#>decision to live the “van life”</a> that had her trekking across the country to several national parks.</p><p>Gabby’s father Joe also sported a lefthand tattoo mimicking a set of two vines that wrapped around both her and Brian’s fingers</p><p>According to <a href=#>TattooSEO</a>, vine tattoos represent loyalty and a desire to stick by someone’s side.</p><p>Last year, Brian posted a photo of himself and Gabby, which included the caption “<a href=#>Till death do us part</a> or until I wake up, I’m so happy the answer was yes.”</p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>Gabby Petito timeline</h3><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000679560590-6.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Gabby Petito, 22, was last seen on August 24, leaving a hotel in Utah.
