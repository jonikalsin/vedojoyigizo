She is <strong>22 years old</strong> currently and her zodiac sign is Virgo. Her mother’s name is Lisa Brawner Gonzalez.</p><p>Moreover, she studied at Lake Mary High School, where she was part of the soccer program. Later, she attended the Orlando Surf Expo in 2015 where she met the guys from the company Roark.</p><p>She is extremely well-traveled. Her love for surfing and the sea has taken her to Australia, England, Ireland, New York, and California.&nbsp;However, she is a skilled surfer and even posted a picture of herself with an all-time great professional Kelly Slater to her Instagram account. Her family and friends make regular appearances in her content.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66362 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Gabriela-Gonzalez-fam.jpg alt="Gabriela Gonzalez" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66362 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Gabriela Gonzalez clicking a photo with her mother and brother.
