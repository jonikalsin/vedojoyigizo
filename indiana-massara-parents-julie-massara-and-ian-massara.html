That same year, she also found fame as she joined the cast of the popular web series Chicken Girls as Rooney.</p><p style=text-align:left>In recent times her collabs with one particular social media artist called <a href=#>Mike “Mikey” Tua</a> have caused fans to wonder if more is going on between them. The twosome was seen lip-synching<span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>&nbsp;along to Post Malone’s “Rockstar” while looking kind of flirty throwing their arms around each other. In the rest of the writing though, we are going to talk about an altogether different topic, about Indiana’s parents. So, stay tuned!</span></p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Who Are Indiana Massara’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>On 23 August 2002, Indiana, full name Indiana Marie Ella Massara, was born to a wonderful pair of parents. In 2023, as the same young Indiana turned 21 years old, it’s high time we tell you about the ones who birthed her and gave her life so wonderful.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Julie Massara, Indiana Massara Mother</strong></h3><p>Every now and then, Indiana Massara discusses her beautiful mother Julie Massara on social media. One time for instance, she posted a ‘throwback’ picture of them together and next to it teasingly wrote, “A throwback to when my mum wasn’t mad at me for a messy room… let’s hope she still loves me😂🙈 UPDATE: votes to be forgiven Indi 12 v Julie 1👏🏻👏🏻 #tbt.”</p><p>So, Indiana’s mom is the daughter of Cheryl Smith, a former John Forrest Senior High School alum, and WA College of Agriculture alum Darryl Smith. It is not clear though if these folks from Mandurah, Western Australia are still together because John not long ago updated his status on FB as “Got married on 6 September 2022.”</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Julie Massara Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>She was born as ‘Julie Marie Massara’ on 18 October 1970. So, she turned 52 years old in 2022.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Julie Massara Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Both of Indiana’s parents are into the mining business. According to&nbsp;businessnews.com, following several years of detailed research into the mining services industry, Julie and her husband Ian made the entrepreneurial decision to sell their house to finance the building of Australian Mining Services. It also explained that Julie, through offering superior technical innovation, quick friendly customer care, and meticulous office controls, was able to gain confidence and business with several large multi-national clients. Last known, the enterprise was hoping to reach a turnover of $20 million for 2007.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Is Julie Massara On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Julie Massara was on Instagram <a href=#>@juliemassara</a> with 297 posts and 12.3K followers as of October 2023. In addition to that, one could also give her a follow on Facebook and TikTok @juliesmithmassara.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Ian Massara, Indiana Massara Father</strong></h3><p>Indiana Massara’s dad has been very supportive of her in everything she does. That includes her choice of profession. Every time, Indiana comes with a new single/album it is Ian who first raves about it among his people. He also talks about it on social media. In January 2018, when the single “Smoke In Your Eyes” was out, he took to his FB to gush that he was so proud of how hard his daughter worked to make this happen. He did something similar when “Say It Back” dropped in October 2019.</p><p>Indiana too can be often seen featuring her dad on her own social media posts, even more on occasions like Father’s Day. She loves to refer to him as her “OG”.</p><p>You might also want to know that Ian has a bunch of siblings named Terry Massara, Brian Massara, Kevin Lisa Massara Boomer, and Margaret Hansen.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Ian Massara Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ian Massara was reportedly born before 1968. Also, he celebrates his birthday on January 23rd. So, Ian may be turned at least 55 years old in 2023.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Ian Massara Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ian Massara is a global mining consultant. Since January 2011, he has been self-employed and provided consultant services in the mining industry to major clients from Australia, China, the USA, Chile, Denmark, and Indonesia.</p><p>When Ian gets some time to himself from all that, he loves going on rides. Even better, he does that with the purpose of fundraising to support projects like cancer research. Back in November 2022, for instance, it was his 3rd year riding to beat cancer. Also, at that time, he had promised that he would be taking a stand against cancer and backing the brilliant brains at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in 2023.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Is Ian Massara On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Indeed, Ian Massara was discoverable on Instagram. As of October 2023, his IG account <a href=#>@ianmassara</a> included 27 posts and 6,281 followers, and on it, he described herself as a “father of Indiana and Presley Massara”. Besides that, Ian also showed now and then glimpses of his life on Facebook and TikTok @ianmassara.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>Where Do Indiana Massara Parents Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of October 2023, both of Indiana’s parents were seemingly residing in Perth, Western Australia.</p><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>How Many Kids Do Indiana Massara Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Indiana is not the only child of her parents. There are two more. One is Indiana’s brother Presley Massara. As of 2023, he was based in Perth, Western Australia, and worked as a manager to Miss Cara, drag queen and “Pop Royalty Winner 2022”. Besides that, as an actor Presley has also appeared on The Pineville Heist (2016), Sh!T Happens (2014), and The Book of Truth (2015).</p><p>Also, Presley is older than Indiana as he was born on 30 August 2000. He was a performer from an early age. He was only three when he won his first talent competition with a cover of “True Colors.” A year later, he started appearing in commercials.</p><ul><li><h4 style=text-align:left><strong>Are Indiana Massara’s Parents Still Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Indiana Massara’s parents’ current relationship status was unclear.
