Season 3 of the reality drama series will premiere on January 30, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The series features three powerful African-American couples from Huntsville, Alabama who work in the real estate industry. The audience has been hooked for the past two seasons with the everyday ups and downs in their lives and their struggles to manage work and relationships. Amid all their personal turmoils, they come together to revitalize the city with their real-estate venture The Comeback Group.&nbsp;</p><p>Wondering who feature in the show this time around? Read on.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a7e9a86c-06ee-4bd1-80aa-689cc37046ee.jpg><p>Let us take a look at the couples featured in the show.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Melody Holt</h2><p>Melody Holt is a producer as well as the star of 'Love & Marriage: Huntsville'. She was married to Martell Holt for 12 years, with whom she shares four children. An alumna of Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical University, she was a teacher who decided to follow her dreams and became an entrepreneur. She is also the CEO of Holt & Holt Entrepreneurship LLC since October 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Melody filed for divorce from Martell in April 2020 due to Martell’s alleged long-term affair with mistress Arione Curry. Despite splitting and getting back together multiple times with Martell, Melody has finally separated from him after the news about Arione Curry’s pregnancy surfaced. After filing for divorce, Melody has moved to Atlanta and is currently co-parenting their kids with Martell. In the past, she has occasionally reverted back to Martell’s sarcastic jibes on social media.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Martell Holt</h2><p>The teacher-turned-businessman is the husband of Melody Holt. He is the COO/Founder of Holt & Holt Entrepreneurship LLC, where his ex-wife Melody is the CEO. In 2016, Martell launched Holt Custom Homes — which assists clients in the home building process.&nbsp;</p><p>Martell has been accused of cheating on Melody during their marriage. His mistress of five years, Arione Curry, is now believed to be pregnant with Martell’s child. After former wife Melody Holt opened up about their tumultuous marriage and Martell’s adultery, he counter-alleged that Melody has also cheated on him with her divorce attorney.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Marsau Scott</h2><p>A member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Marsau Scott is an HBCU graduate of the Alabama A&M University. A commercial general contractor and also the co-owner and president of Scholt Industries, Inc, he is the husband of LaTisha Scott, another star of the show.&nbsp;</p><p>He and his wife were found at odds with the Holts in Season 2. He was also keen to open a cigar lounge but found it difficult to adjust to his wife’s full-time career. Marsau was accused by Martell Holt of cheating with 20 other women, which had upset him and his wife. While he kept his cool, he apparently considered quitting the show.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>LaTisha Scott</h2><p>Married to Marsau Scott for 12 years, LaTisha holds an MBA degree and is a commercial developer. She is also the owner of Infinity Properties. She shares three children with Marsau.&nbsp;</p><p>Her effortless ways of balancing family and career have earned praise time and again.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Maurice Scott</h2><p>Maurice Scott is the brother of Marsau Scott. He is the owner of Credit 1 USA and also a lawyer, as per his Instagram account bio. He holds a net worth of $7 million. After splitting from his first wife, Maurice got&nbsp;married to Kimmi Grant in the first season of the show. The couple has one child together. Maurice also has a former wife.</p><h2 class=split>Kimberlee ‘Kimmi’ Scott</h2><p>Kimmi Scott (nee Grant) is an authorized nurse by profession. She met Maurice through mutual friends and married him after eight years of dating. During the pandemic, Kimmi Scott has worked as a nurse and essential worker at the frontline.</p><p>Catch new episodes of ‘Love & Marriage: Huntsville’ Season 3 drops once it drops on OWN on January 30 at 9 pm ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopJ%2Brsm65wKupopmXmnqpwc2tqq%2BhnKGybrnEnqtmnqWhuW6vwKyrZqSZqMFuvsSao6KsqWKxs63MmmSoqKKWtW7DyKedq52pYrumwNaoqaRloprBtr7NrGSsnZGovK95kg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jill-banner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jill Banner">&larr;
