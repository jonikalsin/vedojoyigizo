They first connected in the late 1980s, but their romance fizzled out, and it would be years before they could reconnect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Steve-Harvey-And-Marjorie-Relationship-min-1024x580.jpg><p>Since they made the choice, they haven’t turned back, and their marriage has endured. They’ve accomplished many things together that show why they are the best couple for a relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_kind_of_bond_does_Steve_Harvey_have_with_Marjorie></span><strong>What kind of bond does Steve Harvey have with Marjorie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even though it took a while, Steve Harvey and Marjorie’s relationship started decades prior to their eventual marriage. He would meet her for the first time in 1987 at a Memphis comedy club. It is stated that when Marjorie arrived late, he was in the middle of his act and said something to her that she will never forget.</p><p>“As soon as we met, I told Marjorie, ‘I don’t know who you are, but I’m going to marry you one day. Harvey reportedly said, “That was the beginning,” as reported by Good Housekeeping. They were dating at the time, but their union did not endure.</p><p>They were given a second chance at love after their last relationship failed after just one and a half years when they were introduced by Steve Harvey’s bodyguards in 2005. In a letter that Steve Harvey wrote and Good Housekeeping published, he described the reason for their reunion. He described the encounter as the “best day of his life.”</p><p>In 2005, when my bodyguard Boomerang handed me the phone, I had no idea who was on the other end, he wrote. It was, however, the best day of my life when I heard your voice and recognized it right away. Harvey was certain that they would meet up this time when they reconnected a day later.</p><p>Two years after they reconnected, Marjorie and Steve Harvey were married. Marjorie would wed Steve Harvey a third time, making him her third husband. The two have created a lovely family and house together. When they reconnected, Harvey noted in his letter that “Even though I was making movements, I had nothing,” even though he was headed in the correct way. I’ve been in a bad place for a while, but I think that everything came together for us just in time.</p><p>Steve Harvey has three children from his first marriage to Marcia Harvey and one son from his second marriage to Mary Shackelford. He adopted Marjorie’s three children after the couple were married in 2007 as well. Family is the most important thing to the couple, so they went above and above to make sure everyone was included. In an interview she gave to People Magazine in 2017, Marjorie discussed this.</p><p>She said that everyone in a mixed-race family is starting from a place of brokenness. “We knew this was the right course of action. We are now regarded as everyone’s parents.</p><p>Steve Harvey has praised his third marriage, which is functioning well. He claimed in a 2012 interview with People Magazine that “Marjorie changed the way I existed.” “As an adult, I had never been in a fulfilling relationship. I had never been wholly trustworthy or well-liked.</p><p>Marjorie continued, referring to their relationship as “best friends.” This is the first time any one of us has a friend we can talk to about anything. It appears to be a wonderful and happy relationship on the surface. They are also very good at communicating in an honest and open manner.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Donatella Versace Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Net Worth, Young, Daughter, Fashion</a></li><li><a href=#>Keisha Lance Bottoms Wiki, Wikipedia, Bio, Husband Illness, Resigns, House, Children, Instagram</a></li><li><a href=#>Minnie Riperton Bio, Ethnicity, Wikipedia, Daughter, Kids, Wiki, Children, Parents, Apartments</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtoq6Saw6Z5x5qpr52pYq6vsIymmKuin6e2pnnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./james-tanner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Tanner">&larr;
