I feel like now I’m most definitely ready, and wanting to look for a boyfriend”. About what she was bringing to the Villa she explained, “Hopefully fun! I can definitely be opinionated so I’m not sure how that’s going to go down.”</p><p>She is also interested to bond with the girls, adding: “With regards to Love Island, it is a show to find love. Girl code is definitely important to me, but I think it’s that balance isn’t it – I’ve got to put myself first!”</p><p>About the qualities she was looking for in the guy, she explained, “I don’t like guys that show off, like flashy, showy-offy guys – just have a personality and make me laugh”. She added about one date that was a complete disaster, “One guy tried to purposefully show off his car keys. We were in the middle of a restaurant”.</p><p>Plus, it is pride month, Amber is also representing the LGBTQ community and Tasha Ghouri after they shared a kiss in the first episode. In the show, she was also challenged to deliver her best chat-up to the girl she fancied the most. A male contestant Luca tried to shut her down when he quipped, “You can’t do that!”.</p><p>‘Why can’t I?’ Amber replied, before adding: ‘I’ve got a good one. Tash, fancy giving us a tash?’</p><p>This got the LGBTQ community riled up on Twitter. Some were excited and others were disappointed.</p><p>A week before the premiere of the show Amber announced, “It’s official and the secret is finally out! Our beautiful girl Amber will be joining ITV2’s Love Island this summer.
