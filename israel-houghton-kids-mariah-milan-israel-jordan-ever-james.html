Here you’ll discover their age, job, and current residence. We unfold all the information here in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Meet Mariah, Milan, & Israel, Israel Houghton Kids With His First Wife</strong></h3><p>American contemporary Christian musician Israel Houghton was previously married to his ex-wife Meleasa Houghton. Meleasa was born on 1 March 1964, she is currently 58 years old. They allegedly first met in a Pittsburgh church in the early 1990s while he was preaching to the local congregation there in his capacity as a minister. After the service, her father, who was also present at the church, presented him to her after he had seen her in the crowd.</p><p>In one interview, Israel described Meleasa as “love at first sight”. The couple married merely 4 months after getting to know each other and tied the knots in 1994.</p><p>The couple shared three children together. They welcomed their daughter Mariah Houghton on 31 August 1996. Meleasa was 32 years old when she had her. Currently, Mariah is 26 years old. She is currently in Nashville, Tennessee. She is a <a href=#>singer</a> who grew up singing in church and eventually led worship for Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas.</p><p>Five years later, the couple gave birth to their son Israel Demlan “Sonny” Houghton Jr. He was born on 16 September 2001. Two years later on 21 October 2003, Milan “Lillie” Houghton was born.</p><p>Sonny is currently based in Los Angeles, California. He is working as a music producer & songwriter.</p><p>The youngest of three Milan Houghton is currently 18 years old. On her 16th birthday, Meleasa wished her daughter, “Dear daughter and my baby Milan Lillie, Happy sweet 16. 🎁🎂Today and every day I celebrate you. I am fortunate to kiss your face and watch movies with you. I’m fortunate to hear you sing around the house. I’m so fortunate to hear your laughter when you are with your friends being funny girls.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel had cheated on his then-wife “to ignore the problems in his marriage”. He reportedly separated from his wife five years before they ended up getting divorced in 2016. While he was married, he had also allegedly fathered other two children named Kingston and Khristian respectively in 2012 and 2014. He was sued by an alleged mistress named De Vawn Moreno.</p><h3><strong>Meet Ever James, Israel Houghton First Child With Adrienne Bailon</strong></h3><p>After his divorce, Israel Houghton married his current wife Adrienne Bailon. They tied the knots on 11 November 2016 in an intimate ceremony with not more than 70 guests at the Hotel Plaza Athénée in Paris. Speaking about their marriage, Adrienne said, “I’ve never felt what I feel right now. I can’t even describe what it is, but it’s such a peace mixed with total excitement.”</p><p>On their 5th wedding anniversary, Adrienne posted on her Instagram, “5 years almost to the minute I am posting this picture. This is our moment after our breathtaking unforgettable ceremony • rushing off to take an official exclusive picture for <a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@people</a> magazine before speeding back to celebrate the reception with our 86 guests in a room set for 60 people lol. And it’s been that kind of beautiful chaotic yet super mad peaceful ride ever since. The greatest adventure of love and life I’ve ever intentionally signed up for.”</p><p>She concluded the post, “I am in awe of God’s gift in @adriennebailon. She is truly my person, my anthem, my happily Ever Adrienne, you took a measurable risk betting on me. And for the last One Thousand-Eight Hundred-Twenty-Days or 43,800 hours, you have been present in every breath and heartbeat. And I look forward to spending at least the rest of forever enjoying us and proving you absolutely right. Happy Anniversary Baby.”</p><p>They started dating only in 2016 but met each other for the first time on the set of the movie, In Love With A Church Girl which was produced by Israel. The couple began dating when they fortuitously became neighbors in 2016, and the rest is history.</p><p>Israel inspired Adrienne to make a musical comeback after a protracted absence from her first love owing to the machinations of the music business, and the couple has experienced a joyful partnership. The couple recorded a duet, which appears on Houghton’s album “Road to Demask Us” in 2018.</p><p>Adrienne Bailon has been open about her problems to become a mother despite being married for almost four years. She has always been outspoken about her wish to be a mother. The stunning actress shared how she has been having trouble conceiving in a 2018 episode of “The Real.”</p><p>She said, “It isn’t what I thought it would be. I think so many people are very insensitive to that, in the sense [that] I know you guys are like, ‘Is she pregnant?’ ‘Her face is fuller’…”</p><p>Adrienne also admitted that she never thought having a baby would be difficult because she always assumed her Latino heritage and her broad hips would make getting pregnant simple. The talented actress explained that despite their reproductive issues, she is not allowing them to influence her marriage and that she is able to remain positive because of her faith and her conviction that God’s timing is the greatest.</p><p>But in 2022, her prayers have been heard.</p><p>Adrienne has welcomed her firstborn. The proud parents shared the news via Instagram with a lovely photo cuddling their newborn son, Ever James. <span>“Our baby boy is here & we are so in love!” the former “The Real” co-host star gushed. “If you have followed our love story … you know that our journey to baby has been very challenging. But God is true to His word and His promises.”</span></p><p>“We have quietly prayed while sitting on this most magnificent secret for the last nine months,” the new mom continued. “He is worth every tear, every disappointment, every delayed prayer, every IVF cycle, every miscarriage. Everything.”</p><p>She added, “All we feel is joy and overwhelming love & gratitude. Grateful to God, to our angel surrogate, and to all of our friends and family who have stood with us for over 5 years on this journey”.</p><p>The couple thanked their “angel surrogate” for their beautiful blessing.</p><p>Adrienne is 38 years old who celebrated her birthday in October 2021.</p><h3><strong>Meet Jordan Houghton, Israel Houghton First Child</strong></h3><p>Jordan Houghton, the son Israel had before getting married to his first wife, reportedly lived with his mother in Scottsdale, Arizona. He made a headline after proposing to his now-wife Leaira Gavern Houghton during his audition on season 18 of American Idol. At the time, he described her as “probably the greatest person that’s ever been made”.</p><p>Jordan flew Gavern’s mother, brother, and sister out to Hollywood from Florida to be there for the big event. Later, in February 2019, Jordan and Leaira shared their wedding vows.</p><p>On 4 May 2021, Jordan welcomed his son Nova Houghton with Leaira.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Who Has The Custody Of Israel Houghton Kids?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>All children of Israel Houghton, except Ever James, are adults so neither Israel nor Meleasa shares their custody.
