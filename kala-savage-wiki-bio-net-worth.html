Similarly, the Savage siblings successfully left their marks in the Hollywood industry with their creativity. Fred Savage dominated the TV industry in the Late 80s by appearing in the famous TV series ‘The Wonder Years.’ Likewise, Ben Savage did the same in the late 90s and early 00s by starring in the hit TV series ‘Boy Meets World.’ And the sister&nbsp;Kala Savage made an impact in the industry working on camera. The actress has appeared in various TV series. Let’s get to know a bit more about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Childhood</h2><p>Kala was born on October 16, 1978, in Highland Park, Illinois. She had a typical and financially stable childhood as her parents worked as real estate agents and consultants. She grew up with her two brothers, Fred and Ben happily. Her grandparents were Jewish from Poland, Germany, Ukraine, and Latvia. All the siblings were raised in a strict Reform Judaism.&nbsp;Her education qualifications still need to be made public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kala-Savage.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career</h2><p>The actor started her career when she was young when she appeared as a little monster in the movie ‘Little Monsters’&nbsp; (1980), while her brothers played Eric and Brian. The adorable siblings looked adorable playing in the film. However, the movie didn’t do too remarkably, scoring 6.3 on IMDB and 80% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Later the same year, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared</a> in the soap opera ‘Santa Barbara’ in 1989 as Anissa for 6 episodes in the fifth season. This was the last time she’d appeared on screen as a teenager.</p><p>She returned to the screen when she appeared in MTV’s anthropology series ‘Undressed’ in 1999 for two episodes ‘There in the Van’ and ‘I know What You Did Last Hummer.’ She then appeared in the hit sitcom series ‘That 70s Show’ (2001) as young Paula in the episode ‘Eric’s Naughty No No’. Along with this, she also appeared in ‘Diagnosis Murder’ as Sandra and ‘Felicity’ as Lila in the same year. In 2002 she guest starred in ‘NYPD Blues’ as Katie in the episode ‘Oedipus Wrecked’. The actress also appeared in ‘Boston Public’ in the episode ‘Chapter fifty-four .’ However, her most notable appearance occurred in the same year when she guest starred in ‘8 Simple Rules’ as Lacey in the same year for about 3 episodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She has also written a song for the movie ‘Daddy Day Camp’ named ‘Hey Juanita’. After working 19 years as an actor, she finally decided to call it quits in 2008.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>She has an estimated net worth of about $5 Million. She earns most of her wealth from Yeezy sneakers. Her husband, Jared Flamm, estimated net worth is around $1 -$5 million.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family</h2><p>Kala was born to the family of Joanne and Lewis Savage. The former actress has earned most of the worth from Joanne, a real estate broker, and Lewis, a consultant. Real estate agents earn about $84k on average, and consultants make about $72k on average. This shows that the Savage siblings have grown up comfortably.&nbsp;</p><p>Kala is currently married to the musician Jared Flamm. The two have been married for around 19 years after they tied the knot in 2003. The couple has no children and has acknowledged non-parenting life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fred Savage:</h2><p>Her brothers are successful actors and producers in Hollywood.

Due to this, he got the role of Kevin Arnold in ‘The Wonder Years in 1988. He stayed loyal to his fan and kept playing the role until the series ended in 1993. His most recent role was in the sitcom ‘Friends from College’ (2017), where he portrayed Max Adler, a gay literary agent.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ben Savage:</h2><p>Just like his older brother and sister, Ben Savage has also had an incredible working record.
