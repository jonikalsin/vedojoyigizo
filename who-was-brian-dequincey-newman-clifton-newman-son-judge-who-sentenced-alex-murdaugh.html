In addition to his professional accomplishments, Brian was well-known for being the son of an American lawyer and at-large judge of the South Carolina Circuit Court, Clifton Newman.</strong></p><p>Clifton is well known for handling several well-known cases, including Alex Murdaugh, who was given a life term in jail on March 2, 2023. The abrupt death of the Newman family’s son Brian a few months before was a devastating event in their lives. Let’s learn more about Brian now.</p><h2><span id=Who_Was_Brian_DeQuincey_Newman_the_son_of_Clifton_Newman>Who Was Brian DeQuincey Newman, the son of Clifton Newman?</span></h2><p>Being an attorney himself, Brian DeQuincey Newman followed in the footsteps of his father. He was a member of the Columbia City Council and an assistant solicitor at the same time. As was already noted, Clifton’s son served as Columbia’s youngest councilor. For your information, Brian was born in the United States of America on December 22, 1982. Brian attended Spring Valley High School before going on to Morehouse College in terms of his schooling. His enrollment at the University of South Carolina School of Law followed that.</p><h2><span id=What_Caused_the_Death_of_Clifton_Newman8217s_Son_Brian_DeQuincey_Newman>What Caused the Death of Clifton Newman’s Son, Brian DeQuincey Newman?</span></h2><p>On January 3, 2023, Brian DeQuincey Newman passed away at the age of 40. According to his obituary, Brian’s death was supposedly due to a heart attack. According to his relatives, Newman had a heart attack after a blood clot. So, after Brian’s passing, the Newman family issued a statement. People were saddened and devastated to hear it at that point. They, therefore, paid respect to the deceased soul and sent the family sympathy notes.</p><p>His Father was preoccupied at the moment with the case of Alex Murdaugh, who had just received a sentence for murdering his wife and their kid. Additionally, funeral services for Brian were conducted on January 9, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. at Brookland Baptist Church, located at 1066 Sunset Boulevard in West Columbia.</p><p>Brian DeQuincey Newman: Was He Married? An Examination of His Family</p><p>There are no known marriage records for Brian DeQuincey Newman. As a result, we cannot provide information on his wife or children. Newman, who was 40 years old and, as we all know, always liked to keep his affairs to himself. He just rose to public fame as Clifton Newman’s son.</p><p>In addition, Brian’s parents, Clifton Newman, and Patricia Newman, are still alive. He shared his family with two sisters, Jocelyn and Kellee Newman, and a brother, Corwyn. Since they met at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, his parents have been acquainted. They have been together ever since.</p><h2><span id=Alex_Murdaugh_Was_He_Guilty_A_Case_Update>Alex Murdaugh: Was He Guilty? A Case Update</span></h2><p>Yes, Alex Murdaugh was held responsible for the deaths of his wife Maggie, and son Paul. In addition, Alex was found guilty of two counts of using a weapon while committing a crime. Alex was convicted on Friday, March 2, 2023, and given a life sentence. Murdaugh also assured the court that he was innocent and that he would never harm his children or wife. In addition, Murdaugh will still stand prosecution in the future for several financial offenses. He will therefore serve his sentence in jail.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Notyourgothgirlfriend</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Medukarabu</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Lili Sixx</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>lawyer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Was Dick Butkus Sick | Illness And Health Update</a></h3>Dick Butkus, the legendary linebacker, was known for his ability to physically create drama.
