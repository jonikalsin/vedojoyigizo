So, she missed out on the chance to be a part of the shared house in 2022. But the opportunity has knocked once again on her door. She’s now a part of all-exclusive Black entrepreneurs on the </span><i><span>Summer House </span></i><span>spinoff, </span><i><span>Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Bria Fleming Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Bria Fleming On Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard</b></h3><p><span>Stepping things up, Bravo’s</span><i><span> Summer House</span></i><span> spinoff </span><i><span>Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard</span></i><span> featured only Black entrepreneurs to share space during the hottest months of the year. Obviously, this meant a lot of relationship drama, friendship scuffles, love triangles, and more!</span></p><p><span>“If you don’t know, Black excellence is Martha’s Vineyard, and Martha’s Vineyard is Black excellence,” Bria Fleming says in the trailer. However, she only knew about the Vineyard’s history after she joined the show.</span></p><p><span>Martha’s Vineyard actually has a long history of hosting Black vacationers, and it was one of the first beach destinations where African Americans could vacation and purchase a property.</span></p><p><span>“Some have asked why the show has an all-Black cast, so I think when people learn more about Martha’s Vineyard, they’ll get a clearer understanding,” Bria added.</span></p><p><span>Reminiscing her journey on the show, Bria shared that her teenage self would be thrilled. “Going into middle school, I watched all these reality shows. Then I went to high school in Calabasas, so obviously the Kardashians were top of mind,” she explained. “It took a long time to get to this point, but I’m glad to have been able to accomplish my goals – and to be on such a big show because Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard is a big deal. Being on an all-Black cast, and the history behind the setting … it’s a lot”</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, she was honored to be able to represent the Black community and to show Black Excellence. But having said that, she also points out that at the end of the day, she’s only being herself and can’t represent everybody.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Bria Fleming Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Bria Fleming garnered a net worth of under $1 million by 2023.</span></p><p><span>A fashion entrepreneur, Bria is the founder of three beauty and fashion brands: Bria Beauty Cosmetics, Bria Beauty Skin, and House of Louisa. She revealed that as a young Black woman of color, she found it hard to find colors that she felt comfortable in. “I love dark lip colors, and I could never really find products that worked for me,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Thus, she launched her own beauty line — starting with lip kits.</span></p><p><span>In addition to this, Bria has also dabbled in the film industry. After studying cinema in Los Angeles, she starred in several productions such as </span><i><span>Hidden Secrets </span></i><span>(2012), </span><i><span>Heavens to Betsy</span></i><span> (2017), and </span><i><span>Room 203 </span></i><span>(2022).</span></p><h3><b>Bria Fleming Age</b></h3><p><span>Bria Fleming was 27 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She is 4 years younger than her best friend Shanice Henderson.</span></p><h3><b>Is Bria Fleming Dating Still Dating Simon Marco?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Bria Fleming is still dating her boyfriend Simon Marco as of 2023.</span></p><p><span>Bria and Simon officially started their relationship on May 23, 2022, after meeting at the Cannes Film Festival. Just within months of dating, Bria then moved to Germany from NY to be close to Simon.</span></p><p><span>You might have also seen Simon on </span><i><span>Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard</span></i><span>. His appearance caused a stir with some stars saying that the pair wouldn’t even last six months.</span></p><p><span>Guess Bria was right about the haters. “You know haters will always have something to say. Simon and I send kisses from the other side of the pond,” the star said.</span></p><p><span>Also, the lovebirds have moved back to New York to build our new life in the Big Apple.</span></p><p><span>The last we saw them, Simon had surprised her with a car on Valentine’s Day.</span></p><p><span>Talking a little about Simon, he is an entrepreneur and a brand manager of Watch Room.
